Create a GitHub README hero image for "Supex" — a sci-fi movie poster.

IMAGE: Dramatic cinema banner, retro-futuristic vector illustration
CANVAS: 3200×900px, 32:9 ultrawide, dark atmospheric background

STYLE:
Retro-futuristic vector illustration in the style of 1960s-70s sci-fi movie posters. Flat colors with clean edges — no gradients, no photorealism. Bold geometric shapes and strong silhouettes. Art deco meets space age aesthetics. Limited color palette with high contrast. Think vintage NASA posters, classic pulp sci-fi book covers, screenprint/risograph aesthetic. Subtle halftone texture optional. Clean, graphic, iconic.

COMPOSITION:
Horizontal panoramic layout — action spreads from center outward to both sides in a dramatic horizontal sweep.

LEFT SIDE:
Two robot figures in dynamic poses, facing right toward the center. Angular, industrial design — functional, not cute. Give them short antennas (behind the "ear" area or on the top/back of the head) that subtly catch the human’s control signals. Glowing eyes emit focused laser beams that arc toward the center and slightly upward toward the 3D scene above. Positioned at different depths for parallax effect.

CENTER (focal point):
A human figure wearing a sleek VR helmet/headset, shown from chest up or full body. Posture suggests intense focus — hands slightly raised, fingers spread as if conducting an orchestra (explicitly "commanding" the robots, not merely observing). The figure is a "programmer/hacker/3D designer" archetype — wearing a hoodie or tech-wear jacket.

CONTROL SIGNALS:
Add a small **radio-control icon** near the hands/chest/belt (NOT a Wi‑Fi symbol) — classic broadcast/radio glyph: a central dot or tiny antenna mast with concentric arcs, or a small “TX” badge. From the helmet and/or this icon, emit **radio-wave style** control signals (concentric arcs / radar-like rings) branching outward horizontally to the robots’ antennas.

RIGHT SIDE:
Two more robot figures mirroring the left side, facing left toward center. Same industrial aesthetic. Give them short antennas (behind the "ear" area or on the top/back of the head) that subtly catch the human’s control signals. Their eye-beams also converge toward the center and slightly upward toward the 3D scene above.

3D SCENE BEING CREATED (above center):
Where all the robot eye-beams converge above the human figure, a wireframe 3D scene materializes — geometric shapes, architectural forms emerging from the light. The beams are aimed slightly upward into this zone, as if the robots are both creating and scanning the scene.

The scene is half-solid, half-wireframe — caught in the moment of creation. **Where the beams hit, surfaces “resolve” into solid forms** (crisp hard-edged transition, no gradients). Areas not directly struck remain wireframe or partially incomplete. Particles and geometric fragments float around the impact points. This is the visual climax but kept compact due to limited vertical space.

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
Use color contrast to create depth — dark silhouettes against lighter background areas. The human figure and robots rendered as bold graphic shapes. Robot eye-beams as clean geometric rays in coral/orange. The 3D creation zone as the brightest area (cream/white) drawing the eye. Layered elements create depth without gradients.

TITLE PLACEMENT:
"SUPEX" in large, bold retro typography — blocky, geometric letterforms in cream/white. Positioned at bottom center or integrated into the composition. No metallic effects, just flat solid color. Tagline "Mind the Models" in smaller text below. Style similar to vintage sci-fi movie titles.

COLOR PALETTE (limited, 4-5 colors max):
- Deep teal/dark cyan for shadows and dark areas
- Coral/orange-red for accents, beams, and highlights
- Cream/off-white for mid-tones and background glow
- Muted sage green for secondary elements
- Black for outlines and deepest shadows

MOOD:
Epic, empowering, futuristic. The human is clearly in control — commanding an army of AI assistants to build their vision. There's tension and energy in the composition, like the climactic moment of a sci-fi film.

SMALL DETAILS:
Geometric decorative elements — circles, lines, dots scattered in background. Concentric rings or arcs suggesting energy waves (lean into classic radio/radar aesthetics rather than Wi‑Fi iconography). Small floating geometric shapes (cubes, pyramids) near the 3D creation zone. Subtle halftone dot pattern in some areas for texture.

AVOID: Photorealism, gradients, 3D rendering, cute/friendly robots, more than 5 colors, cluttered composition, any logos or brand marks except the title, realistic lighting or shadows.
