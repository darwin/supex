## Agent Prompts

This directory contains documentation and prompts for AI agents that interact with SketchUp via Supex MCP tools.

### Purpose

When an AI agent (Claude, etc.) works on a SketchUp project using Supex, it needs guidance on:
- How to use the MCP tools (eval_ruby_file, take_screenshot, etc.)
- SketchUp Ruby API patterns and best practices
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

These files provide that context. They are designed to be included in agent system prompts or referenced during conversations.

### Structure

```
docs/agents/
├── prompt.md          # Main agent prompt (comprehensive)
├── workflow.md        # Extended workflow examples
├── best_practices.md  # Geometry pitfalls and troubleshooting
├── api/               # SketchUp Ruby API docs (symlink)
├── stdlib/            # Standard library helpers (symlink)
└── README.md          # This file
```

**Note on symlinks**: `api/` and `stdlib/` are symlinks that may point outside this project. When reading files from these directories, use direct paths like `supex-docs/stdlib/README.md` rather than glob searches, as glob tools typically don't follow symlinks across directory boundaries.

### File Descriptions

- **prompt.md** - Complete agent prompt with workflow, patterns, tool reference, and API pointers. This is the primary document agents should read.
- **workflow.md** - Extended examples of common geometry operations. Supplements prompt.md.
- **best_practices.md** - Detailed troubleshooting guide for geometry issues (coplanar faces, reversed normals, etc.).
- **api/** - Symlink to `docgen/generated-sketchup-api-docs/`. Contains markdown docs for SketchUp Ruby API classes.
- **stdlib/** - Symlink to `stdlib/`. Reusable utility functions for geometry, entities, colors, etc. Agents should prefer these over writing custom helpers. See `stdlib/README.md` for API reference.

### Usage

**In example projects**: Reference these docs in the project's agent configuration or CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
For SketchUp modeling guidance, see: /path/to/supex/docs/agents/prompt.md
```

**In custom prompts**: Include or reference `prompt.md` as the primary source of SketchUp modeling instructions.

### Maintenance

- `prompt.md` is the source of truth for agent behavior
- `api/` is auto-generated by `docgen/` - do not edit directly
- When adding new MCP tools, update the Tools Reference section in `prompt.md`
